# Dad Jokes

The [Dad Jokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) includes an endpoint for [getting a random dad joke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke). Your task is to build an app using React that displays a random dad joke from the API with the push of a button!

## Prerequisites

## Bonus

Animate your dad jokes!

When someone pushes the button to get a new dad joke, you should first animate the current dad joke out. Animating out an element typically means creating an animation that takes it from view. Feel free to be creative here! A simple option would be to fade the text out. A crazy, fun option would be to have each character of the joke fly off the screen in a different direction.

Once your old joke has animated out, then you'll want to animate in your new joke. Animating something out takes it away from view, animating something in brings it in to view. Again, feel free to be creative here! A simple option is to fade the text in. A crazy, fun option would be to have the individual characters come in from all different directions.
